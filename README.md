I'm a seasoned developer with years of experience. My passion lies in crafting top-notch solutions, and I'm all about efficient and high-quality development.

📱 Mobile Developer: From native development to the world of multiplatform. Proficient in Apple ecosystem, exploring Android, and diving into cross-platform development with Flutter and KMM for multiplatform apps.

Expanding beyond:

🚀 Backend Developer: Beyond mobile, I'm comfortable in Golang, crafting services for various needs.

🤖 Telegram Bot Enthusiast: I bring Telegram bots to life, adding a touch of functionality and a dash of personality.

🌐 Language Explorer: Dabbling in the coding landscape, trying out different languages and frameworks. Because learning is a journey that never ends.


My projects are more than just code for me; they're my sandbox for learning and experimentation. No fancy titles here, just a passionate coder. 🚀📱💻✨
